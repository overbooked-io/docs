  your API requests. If your request fails, Overbooked API returns an error
  using the appropriate status code.

# Errors

## Error codes

In general, there are three status code ranges you can expect:

* `2xx` success status codes confirm that your request worked as expected
* `4xx` error status codes indicate an error because of the information provided \(e.g., a required parameter was omitted\)
* `5xx` error status codes are rare and indicate an error with Overbookedâ€™s servers

Below is a list of possible error codes that can be returned, along with an additional description.
